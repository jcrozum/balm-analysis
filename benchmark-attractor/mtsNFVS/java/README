*The BN file must be a file with extension .bnet with BoolNet format (http://colomoto.org/biolqm/doc/format-bnet.html).
*The BN file must be placed in the "networks" folder.
*The "predata" folder contains the files showing the set of minimal trap spaces (.mts), the set of fixed points of the reduced STG (.std), and the minimum FVS (-fvs.txt). Now, mtsNFVS only works on the networks having information files in the "predata" folder.
