# Model generators

This folder contains files that were used to generate random NK and NCF models.

You don't have to use these generators to use the artefact (generated models are already included).

To generate random models, you need `pystablemotifs` installed, and then simply execute either `generate_random_nk.py`, or `generate_random_ncfs`. 

The models counts, sizes, output directory and other parameters (e.g. `p` and `K` for NK models) are directly hardcoded at the beginning of each script.
